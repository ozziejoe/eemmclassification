therapy sessions, we prepared four distinct text fields for large language model (LLM) analysis: raw client utterances, raw therapist utterances, three-turn rolling windows of therapist‚Äìclient dialogue, and brief summaries of those windows. For each turn in a session, the dataset preserved the verbatim text of the therapist and client contributions as separate fields. These single-turn utterances were classified directly without any modification. In contrast, the rolling window fields were constructed to capture broader contextual patterns: at each conversational point, up to three sequential therapist‚Äìclient exchanges (i.e., turns) were\n","combined into a single block of text (RawText_3Turn). These rolling windows allowed for a temporally grounded understanding of interactional dynamics.\n","\n","Each RawText_3Turn entry was paired with a GPT-generated summary (Summary_3Turn) that described key psychological shifts or themes in one to two sentences. Summaries were produced using a standardized prompt that instructed the model (GPT-3.5-turbo) to analyze the interaction and extract central themes without quoting directly. The full 3-turn transcript and the resulting summary were stored alongside each corresponding entry. All four fields‚Äîraw client, raw therapist, rolling 3-turn text, and rolling summary‚Äîwere then classified using two sets of category definitions (full and brief), allowing us to compare model ratings across raw and summarized representations. This multi-layered design enabled us to examine how different levels of abstraction and context contribute to the identification of social processes in
